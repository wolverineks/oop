## Background
This is a short exercise in Object Oriented Programming. It was originally a
technical interview challenge.

This code will parse a csv file, create categories, sub_categories, and
questions. From here, it returns to the user a list of arbitrary count, of
question ids that favors the least frequently selected category, the least
frequently selected sub_category, and
the least frequently selected question.
